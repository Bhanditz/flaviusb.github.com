Please be aware, this is a work of fiction.

Or, why the world is horribly, irredeemably broken, and must be destroyed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The nature of time
- The (necessary) existance of Death
- The Will which, divided, consumes itself (ie the Schopenhauer problem)
- Fundamental problems with multimodal systems of first order logic (ie pathologies when you have both Deontic and Epistemic modal operators)
- The existance of the Dark Future

This is *similar* to a post-human manifesto (contrast: trans-human manifesto), with the caveat that the universe does not admit a successor to Humanity.

On an optimistic note, your 'End of the World' plan may include the possibility of a *Rapture* like event; still an end of history, still an Apocalypse, but one with a nominally happy ending. This possibly goes under trans-humanism, depending on your mental model of 'afterwards'.
