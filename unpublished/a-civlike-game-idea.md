The 'you' in the game need not follow a fixed faction; you should have opportunities at most steps to either change factions, or maybe even to bifurcate your locus of experience.

That is, a Civ like game attempts to show the world from the point of view of a 'government'... As a civilization is an organism, it can bifurcate and change...

So, you could 'be' anything that is remotely like a single government... in some situations, you could even be both the 'legitimate' government and a rebel faction...

Different regions could follow incredibly different laws or models of government...

Tech-tree as abilities you have
- One country, two laws - allows you to create Special Administrative Regions
- Ecumenicalism - if you are a Theocracy, this allows multiple religions
- Secularism...
- The ... allows you to build a 'counterculture' or 'resistance' group, as well as being the main governmanet
- Empire - allows you to have 'colonies', 'protectorates' and 'satrapies'
- Cultural Imperialism/Metastasis into a 'particular' culture/mode
