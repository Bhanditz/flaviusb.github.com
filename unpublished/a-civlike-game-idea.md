The 'you' in the game need not follow a fixed faction; you should have opportunities at most steps to either change factions, or maybe even to bifurcate your locus of experience.

That is, a Civ like game attempts to show the world from the point of view of a 'government'... As a civilization is an organism, it can bifurcate and change...

So, you could 'be' anything that is remotely like a single government... in some situations, you could even be both the 'legitimate' government and a rebel faction...

Different regions could follow incredibly different laws or models of government...

Tech-tree as abilities you have
- One country, two laws - allows you to create Special Administrative Regions
- Ecumenicalism - if you are a Theocracy, this allows multiple religions
- Secularism...
- The ... allows you to build a 'counterculture' or 'resistance' group, as well as being the main government
- Empire - allows you to have 'colonies', 'protectorates' and 'satrapies'
- Cultural Imperialism/Metastasis into a 'particular' culture/mode - allows you to 'transform' into a culture, infecting what it infects, but living or dying by its rules.

Cults
Almost all cults can benefit from some comon things:
- Number of worshippers
- Construction of temples (require money, auspicious site, faith points, materiels), relics (require convergence, faith points (or special character/event); money and materiel can sometimes mitigate these costs for some kinds of relics)
- Special characters
- Specific kinds of state sponsorship
- Will sometimes have the opportunity to add a Vow to the belief system; this strengthens its potency at a cost

Some cults have tight limits on this
- Vow of Poverty
- Vow of Mystery (ie Elusinian Cult, Mithraism?, Masonry)

Types of cult
- Outsiders
    Contagion
    Build up through 'cult' stuff, temples, 'legitimation' (ie state sponsorship or membership)
- Ikons
    Methods to build up... building, tourism, temples
- Archetypes
