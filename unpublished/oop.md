I want to be able to designate a delegate for a certain interface on a class ie
instance x
type y
instance z
such that for every message a y can receive which is sent to x, z receives it.

I really want the ability to use things like 'inhertance' in very different ways, which map onto the type system; that is, for example,
to be able to say that X delegates certain messages to Y, and certain messages to Z.
